===

## SYNOPSIS 

    sasquatch token id_rsa.pub
    sasquatch decrypt [-i id_rsa] infile

## DESCRIPTION

* Create a random token as a session key with a colleague
* Decrypt the random token on the other side

Sasquatch uses a known ssh public key to bootstrap secure communications
over an insecure line.

## OPTIONS

`sasquatch token <keyfile.pub>`
    
 * `keyfile.pub`: The public key to encrypt for.  If not specified or `-`, read from STDIN.
 * `-q=false`:
   Quiet mode doesn't print out info about the token and prints the token followed by base64 encoded encrypted content on two lines
 * `-token-chars="abcd1234"`:
   Characters to use in generating a token
 
`sasquatch decrypt <infile>`

 * `infile`:
   Input filename.  If not specified or `-`, read from STDIN.
 * `-i="/Users/james/.ssh/id_rsa"`:
   Private key file (identity) to use for decryption

Generates a random token which fills the space available in the RSA key.

## NAMING

Sasquatch was an expansion on an abbreviation that made sense at one time.  The exact origin of the name has been lost.
